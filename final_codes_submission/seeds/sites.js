	description: [
	'Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church was founded in 1794 by Richard Allen as the first African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church in the country. Furthermore, the church stands on the oldest parcel of land continuously owned by African Americans in the United States.',

	'The congregation was founded in 1787 as a breakaway faction of St. George’s Methodist Episcopal Church, located at 4th and Arch Streets. Just a year earlier, the pastor of St. George’s invited Allen to preach at the 5 am worship services. Many of the white members of St. George’s were unwilling to allow black leadership and even full black membership, fearing they would lose credibility and respect in the community. Consequently, many of the African Americans were met with hostility by white members and officers. The church mandated African American congregants only take communion after the white congregation and required segregated seating sections. Offering Rev. Allen the early morning service was a way of segregating the black worshippers from the white members who would come for the later main Sunday service.',

	'Allen’s sermons grew immensely popular, attracting a larger number of African Americans to the church. Allen became seen as an important figure in the African American community and, in 1787, he and Absalom Jones founded the Free African Society, a mutual aid organization that assisted the community and worked to abolish slavery. To accommodate the growing number of African American church goers at St. George’s, a separate balcony was constructed. ',

	'Without knowledge of the new seating, Allen and Jones were praying in the main seating area when an usher attempted to remove the two men and direct them to the balcony. Furious to be interrupted mid-prayer, Jones and Allen led the other African American members out of the church, not to return.',

	'Allen organized the group of black congregants to raise money for their own church. In 1791, Allen bought the lot on the corner of Sixth and Lombard streets and in July of 1794, the first service was held in a former blacksmith shop. Allen became the first bishop of the AME in 1816 and continued to transform Mother Bethel into a center of black life. Prior to Emancipation, the church acted as an important station on the Underground Railroad and a recruiting station during the Civil War. Additionally, the church hosted a school for children and published one of the oldest African American newspapers in the nation, the Christian Recorder, founded in the 1840s. Since the first church, there have been three other church buildings on this site. The fourth and current church was built and dedicated in October of 1890.',

	'The church is still operating today, warmly welcoming visitors to its services. Additionally, the church has a museum featuring church artifacts and memorabilia, items of the Allen family and the tomb where the remains of Allen and his wife, Sarah, are laid to rest. The building itself stands as a symbol of the area’s rich African American history and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.'

	'Philadelphia’s rich history of immigrants is full of examples of racial tension between various ethnic groups. The wave of Irish immigration during the early and mid-1800s, spurred by the Irish potato-rot and famine, brought thousands of Irish immigrants to Philadelphia. Irish immigrants became neighbors with the growing number of African Americans. During the first half of the 19th century, riots and other forms of confrontation erupted as a result of social and economic competition between Irish Catholics and African Americans. Racial tension became increasingly violent as the movement to abolish slavery gained momentum and the Irish feared African Americans would take their jobs. An anti-abolition sentiment transformed into a hostile anti-black sentiment, causing racially charged rhymes to became popular such as,',

	'“When the negroes shall be free. To cut the throats of all they see, Then this dear land will come to be. The den of foul rascality.”',

	'On August 1, 1842, the Young Men’s Vigilant Association gathered with over 1,000 of Philadelphia’s pro-abolitionists. A banner of a slave breaking his chains with the slogan “How grand in age, how fair in truth, are holy Friendship, Love, and Truth” was used to celebrate the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies. The parade of people extended along Lombard between 5th and 8th Streets. An unsympathetic Irish mob attacked the abolitionists near Mother Bethel, setting off three days of rioting. It took militia armed with artillery to restore peace.',

	'The students at Masterman High School in Philadelphia researched and successfully lobbied the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission to create this historic marker at the southeast corner of 6th and Lombard Streets.',

	'Beginning in 1878, retailer and philanthropist Theodore Starr organized a series of charitable organizations that worked to benefit the poor, immigrant and African American populations of this neighborhood. His first establishments were the Progressive Colored Men’s Club, which provided men with the resources for moral and intellectual improvement (gymnasium, baths, library, lectures rooms and healthful games) and a Coal Club. Between 1880 and 1882, Starr bought two plots of land on St. Mary Street that became the Starr Garden, a public playground and gardening center for the neighborhood that worked to improve the environment. Previously, flowers, trees, and grass had been unseen in St. Mary Street and the garden was greatly loved by the community. Additionally, the Starr Bank, Starr Public Kindergarten, St. Mary Street Free Library and Starr Kitchen were all organized before 1895.',

	'The Starr Bank was a saving bank that had no minimum deposit at a time when commercial banks required a minimum deposit of one dollar, an amount many families could not set aside at one time. Along with the bank, many of Starr’s organizations taught families  “thriftiness.” The kindergarten was open year-round and gave small children an educational and fun place to be rather than the streets while their parents were busy working. The library, later called the Starr Library, was the only free circulating library in this part of the city and provided residents of all ages with a place to read and play games. In 1901, the daily attendance was 200- 300 people. The Starr Kitchen was open every day except Sunday and provided nutritious meals at reasonable rates. Additionally, the Kitchen sponsored a Penny Lunch program for school children. Every day, tables would be set up in playgrounds and school selling a small variety of food items for a penny. In 1898, 56,316 lunches were sold to school children. Additionally, the Starr Centre sponsored lecturers to come and speak at the Church of the Crucifixion at 8th and Bainbridge Streets. Lectures were given on topics from English literature and music to politics.',

	'After Starr’s death in 1884, his organizations were left in the hands of Hannah Fox. In 1887, all of Starr’s organizations were assembled as the Starr Centre Association, and Susan Wharton became chairperson in 1900. The Centre continued to grow and provide assistance to thousands of people in the Philadelphia. After 1900, the Centre added a Medical Department, Rainy Day Society, Modified Milk Club, Stamp Savings Club, Work Bureau and expanded the playground.',

	'Here on Rodman Street, between 6th and 7th streets, was the heart of Philadelphia’s worst black slum. Because of this area’s high density of poor, unsanitary dwellings, it saw some of Philadelphia’s first housing experiments. During the early 1880s, Theodore Starr purchased some of the neighborhood’s deteriorating homes on the 700 block of Rodman Street, historically called St. Mary’s Street, which were then fixed up and given modern improvements such as running water, baths and ranges. The homes were rented to working class families as moderate rates. Furthermore, in 1887, Hannah Fox began buying properties on the 600 block of St. Mary that were renovated and then rented out to poor immigrant and black residents.',

	'In 1892, these dwellings became home of the College Settlement Association (CSA) with Susan Wharton as president. Wharton, with other reform-minded women, provided low cost, clean housing and additionally advised their residents in thrift, temperance, sexual morality, hygiene and self-help. It was the CSA  that wanted Du Bois to survey the Seventh Ward, and he and his wife, Nina, lived in the settlement house when Du Bois first came to Philadelphia. The work done by Starr, Fox and Wharton provided the foundation for the Octavia Hill Association, which was organized in 1896 to improve the living condition of the city’s poorer districts. The Association had bought and renovated 28 properties by 1901 where more than 80 families of various nationalities were able to find comfortable, sanitary housing. The Association maintained the buildings, keeping them in repair , and also kept oversight of its tenants.',

	'Octavius Catto was a black educator, intellectual and civil rights activist who is remembered as one of Philadelphia’s most politically active African Americans of the 19th century. After graduating as valedictorian from the Institute for Colored Youth in 1858, he immediately became the assistant to the Institute’s principal and began his influential career in education.',

	'During the Civil War, Catto raised a volunteer regiment of black men to help defend the state. However, General Couch rejected the unit at Harrisburg because the troops were black, fueling Catto to push the color line. He went on to raise eleven regiments of “Colored Troops” that were sent to the front lines. For his efforts during the Civil War, Catto was awarded the position of Major and Inspector General of the 5th Brigade of the National Guard. Following the war, Catto led a boycott to desegregate Philadelphia’s trolley system.',
	'In 1869, Catto was made head of the boy’s department at the Institute while he remained politically active in the city. Additionally, he helped found the first black baseball team in the country, the Pythians. The baseball teamwas forced to play most their games in New Jersey as the majority of Philadelphia’s baseball fields were located in predominately Irish neighborhoods where a black baseball team was not welcome. Despite their popularity among blacks, the Pythians were denied admission to the all-white Pennsylvania Association of Amateur Baseball Players in 1867.',
	'Blacks in Philadelphia were first granted the right to vote during the October 1871 election, creating a particularly tense atmosphere in the Ward. Catto returned home to put on his militia uniform so he could help keep order. Near his home at 8th and South Street, Catto was accosted by an Irish Democrat, Frank Kelly, who proceeded to shoot Catto three times. Kelly, who was later acquitted, fled the scene and left Catto to die of his wounds. The public funeral for Catto included a procession that was the largest the city had seen since that of Abraham Lincoln.',
